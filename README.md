# new_numbers
Toy project for my cousin to learn to solve problems with Python. Reimplementing basic arithmetic operations for new numbers, which are going to be numbers spelled out in all letters.

After doing the project myself, I realized it was a little more complicated than I anticipated. But still lots of fun!
